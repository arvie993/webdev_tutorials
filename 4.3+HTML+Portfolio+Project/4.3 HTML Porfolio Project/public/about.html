<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m Aravind—an AI and data engineer who loves turning ideas into real, useful tools. Born in Madras (Chennai) and raised in New Jersey, I blend a global upbringing with a curiosity for technology, science fiction, history, and sociology. I enjoy building with Azure and Copilot, exploring how thoughtful engineering can make everyday life a little easier and a lot more fun.</p>

<p>Food and culture are a big part of my story. I grew up around South Indian cooking and still unwind by experimenting in the kitchen—especially Chettinad flavors—and speaking Tamil with family. When I’m not tinkering with projects, you’ll find me at the gym, geeking out over anime (One Piece forever), or planning my next trip to explore a new city.</p>

<p>I care about learning, mentoring, and shipping with purpose. Whether it’s a data pipeline, an automation, or a small script that saves someone time, I’m happiest when I’m building and sharing. If you ever want to chat about AI, product ideas, or where to find great biryani, I’m your guy.</p>
